"""This module handles resetting the state of the computer so the robot can work with a clean slate.

For this robot the "state" is just the cached KontAKT credentials. ``open_all``
caches them and returns a :class:`Client`; ``reset`` re-reads them, so the queue
framework can reconnect on a retry. Documents are read from and written back to
KontAKT's local file store over the API, so no external connection is needed.
